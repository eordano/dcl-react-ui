    "We're requesting a grant to run the fifth season of the Decentraland Builders Hackathon — a six-week program that onboards new creators to the SDK and ships playable scenes to Genesis City.\n\nPrior seasons produced 40+ published scenes and brought ~120 first-time builders into the ecosystem. This season focuses on retention: every participant is paired with a mentor and committed to a public post-mortem.",
